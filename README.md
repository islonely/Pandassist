# Pandassist
Pandassist is a tool created to assist homeschool teachers in managing their students grade, subjects, schedules, etc. There used to exist an app on the Google Play Store called Homeschool Helper.

### Note
Pandassist is in very early development. If you have any feature ideas that you would like to see, then please let me know. If you find any bugs/issues feel free to report them. If you yourself are a programmer, then feel free to contribute to the repository.

### Prerequisites
MySQL is currently the only requirement right now. (todo: create database schema file)

And [V](https://vlang.io/) if you're building from source.

### Usage
After cloning the repository, you can build and run the program with `v run .`.

Upon the first run of the program, a config.toml file will be created which you can customize to your liking.
